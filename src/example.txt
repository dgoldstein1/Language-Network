Word Origin & History

test late 14c., "small vessel used in assaying precious metals," from O.Fr.
test, from L. testum "earthen pot," related to testa "piece of burned clay,
earthen pot, shell" (cf. L. testudo "tortoise") and texere "to weave" (cf.
Lith. tistas "vessel made of willow twigs;" see texture). Sense of "trial or
examination to determine the correctness of something" is recorded from 1590s.
The verb in this sense is from 1748. The connecting notion is "ascertaining the
quality of a metal by melting it in a pot." Test-tube is from 1846; test-tube
